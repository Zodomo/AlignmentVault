# AlignmentVault

The `AlignmentVault` contract provides functionality to send ETH to a vault for the purpose of permanently enhancing the floor liquidity of a target NFT collection. While the liquidity is locked forever, the yield can be claimed indefinitely, and is split 50/50 between the vault owner and the NFTX liquidity pool.

This contract was intentionally designed to harness the economic velocity of collection derivatives and direct it into boosting a primary collection, instead of being extractive to the greater community. Instead of hoping derivative teams sweep and hold our prized collections, this code forces their alignment in a way that is not only beneficial, but allows them to retain the economic potential from that aligned capital. This is regenerative finance ("ReFi") for NFTs.

An ERC-1167 factory is deployed to mainnet at `0xD7810e145F1A30C7d0B8C332326050Af5E067d43`. Usage of this is recommended as it will save gas, and vaults deployed with it will automatically be verified by Etherscan.

## Contract Details

**SPDX-License-Identifier:** AGPL-3.0

## Imports

- solady/src/auth/Ownable.sol
- openzeppelin/interfaces/IERC20.sol
- openzeppelin/interfaces/IERC721.sol
- openzeppelin/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol
- liquidity-helper/UniswapV2LiquidityHelper.sol

## Interfaces

- **INFTXFactory:** Interface to interact with NFTX factory, e.g., to get vaults for an asset.
- **INFTXVault:** Interface to fetch the vault ID.
- **INFTXLPStaking:** Interface for depositing into NFTX vault and claiming rewards.
- **INFTXStakingZap:** Interface for adding liquidity to the NFTX vault.

## Contract Initialization

- **initialize:** Initializes all contract variables and NFTX integration.
- **disableInitializers:** Disables the ability to call initialization functions again, recommended post-initialization.

## Ownership Management

- **renounceOwnership:** Overridden to disable the ability, as it would break the vault. A privileged operator is required for it to function properly. If an AlignmentVault is embedded in or used by another contract, it is important that the controlling code be the owner of the vault.

## Utility Functions

- **\_estimateFloor:** Estimates the floor price of the NFT in terms of WETH based on NFTX SLP reserves.
- **alignLiquidity:** Adds NFTs and ETH to the NFTX vault and stakes them. This deepens the floor liquidity of the aligned NFT, utilizing the maximum amount of capital available in the vault to do it.
- **claimYield:** Claims yield generated by the staked NFTWETH SLP. The yield can either be compounded or 50% sent to a recipient. The NFTX LP will always receive 50% of the yield.
- **checkInventory:** Checks the contract's inventory to recognize any new NFTs that were transferred unsafely. The contract must be aware of all NFTs it has in order to use them, so run this before alignLiquidity if any NFT tokenIds are not accounted for!

## Errors

- **InvalidVaultId:** Vault ID is invalid.
- **AlignedAsset:** Unapproved action on an aligned asset (ETH/WETH/NFT/NFTX tokens)
- **NoNFTXVault:** No vault found in NFTX.
- **UnwantedNFT:** Deposited NFT is not the aligned NFT.

## Important Points

- The contract allows for the permanent locking of liquidity into a target NFT collection. While the principal is locked, the rewards (or yield) can be claimed indefinitely.
- It integrates with several other protocols, including NFTX which uses Uniswap, for liquidity management and yield generation.
- The contract comes with initialization procedures to support deployment via the ERC-1167 proxy deployed to ETH mainnet at `0xD7810e145F1A30C7d0B8C332326050Af5E067d43`
- Ownership management is present, though the ability to renounce ownership is intentionally disabled.
- The contract also offers utility functions that estimate floor prices, manage liquidity, and claim yields. There's also a function to check the inventory of the contract against any unsafely transferred NFTs.
- Given the locked nature of liquidity, anyone interacting with the contract should be aware of the permanent nature of deposits.
